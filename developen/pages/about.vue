                We are a team of 1 guy and some interesting thoughts about learning how to code <br>
                and how to make it easier for people to start their journey in the world of programming. <br>
                The main problem is that a lot of sources are too complicated for beginners, <br>
                so i decided to make a website where you can learn all the information you need <br>
                and not getting pushed to learn some PHD type of things, or not get lost in the process. <br>
                We are here to help you, so if you have any questions, feel free to email. <br>
